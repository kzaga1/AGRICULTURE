# Capstone Project: Global Primary School Enrollment (2000–2020)

**Course**: INSY 8413 – Introduction to Big Data Analytics  
**Student**: Clever Karenzi  
**Instructor**: Eric Maniraguha

## 🗂️ Project Description
This project analyzes global trends in **primary school enrollment** using official World Bank data from 2000 to 2020. It applies exploratory data analysis and clustering (KMeans) to group countries by similar education trends.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze historical enrollment patterns for different countries
- Visualize trends over time using Python and Power BI
- Apply KMeans clustering to identify countries with similar behaviors
- Offer insights and policy recommendations for educational development

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Power BI (for dashboard creation)
- World Bank Open Data

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [World Bank – School enrollment, primary (% gross)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRR)
- Format: CSV
- Years: 2000–2020
- Countries: 200+

## ⚙️ Features
- Jupyter Notebook with complete data cleaning, visualization, and clustering
- Power BI Dashboard with slicers, charts, and global map
- Machine Learning clustering with silhouette evaluation

## ✅ Results
- Found three clear clusters of countries:
  - Low but improving enrollment
  - High and consistent enrollment
  - Mixed or declining trends
- Rwanda shows progress, while Finland and US maintain top levels
- Clustering can guide education benchmarking and policy strategy

## 🔮 Future Work
- Add forecasting with time-series models (Prophet, ARIMA)
- Correlate with GDP, literacy rate, and public spending
- Automate dashboard updates with APIs
